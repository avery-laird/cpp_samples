This folder contains only the C++ code that I wrote for a coding task involving sparse matrices.


# 2019

This folder contains some code that I wrote for a course project that used LLVM to instrument programs. It is partially based on an instructor template, so I have annotated all instructor code with comments. 

The aim of the project was first to function much like a sanitizer, and verify each load, store, free, and division is valid. The second component was to make the program more tolerant, by providing default values when an error should occur (see Tolerator.cpp for a more detail explanation).
